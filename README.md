Jon Stein, founder and chairman a graduate of Columbia Business School & Eli Broverman

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Jon began his career in traditional finance, working as a consultant for First Manhatten Consulting Group
He felt that the finance industry lacked impact focus and disliked "making rich people richer and not a lot of actual service provision for everyone else". Jon saw an opportunity to build Betterment, but chose to attend Columbia Business School to 
increase his confidence and business acumen. Jon attended Columbia Business School from 2007-2009 and founded Betterment during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). His previous work representing the big banks, and the associated consumer sentiment 
of the time - opened his eyes to launching Betterment.
